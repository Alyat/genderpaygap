### Semantic network analysis: nouns and adjectives

<p> While the map looks somewhat cluttered at first sight, it reveals 13 quite distinct clusters, as listed below: <br /> 

1. Average & Earnings: discussions revolving around money <br />
2. Dumb & Fuck: This is likely related to comments that could be classified as ‘trolling’ and those related to ‘dooming’ gender pay gap. 
3. Scientific & Argument: This could relate to discussions refuting the existence of any scientific arguments for the validity of gender pay gap. <br />
4. News & Fake: Comments referring to gender pay gap as ‘fake news’. <br />
5. Equal & Rape: ‘Rape’ in the map connects to the terms sexual, false, domestic, legal. The emergence of the term in debates surrounding gender inequality is not all that surprising. However, its connection to ‘equal’ is somewhat ambiguous, but could be related to arguments for men facing gender inequality as well, i.e. arguments such as ‘Men get raped too’. <br />
6. Feminists & Feminist: While we separated these in terms, this mutual appearance could be due to the latter being an adjective. These terms appear together with words such as: third, oppressed, radical, western, which could indicate criticism towards feminism and labelling it as a particularly western phenomenon, also criticising its radical nature. <br />
7. Pregnant & Years: Relates to discussions on the topic of having babies, being a mother, and maternity [leave] months. Could be related to arguments explaining the gender pay gap due to women’s absence from work-life due to pregnancy. <br />
8. White & Race: white relates to words describing class differences whereas race to “white, black, human, racist”. Could refer to discussion on whether gender pay gap takes into account differences in income between different ethnicities. <br />
9. Unexplained & Due: arguments on wage gap is unexplainable and can be caused by different factors such as different choices. In addition the word “discrimination” is related to this cluster. <br />
10. Interview & Peterson: Most likely referring to the debate of Jordan Peterson and Cathy Newman on gender pay gap, in videos 1, 66, and 89. <br />
11. Same & Less: Debates revolving around whether women really earn the same or less. <br />
12. Job & Higher: The pay gap between genders being related to differing education, job, position, and careers. <br />
13. Male & Female: An unsurprising cluster in a discussion revolving around gender inequalities. </p>

<p> Furthermore, on multiple accounts explanations other than gender discrimination are offered for the existence of such gap, for example women’s choices concerning their education, career, and family specifically related to maternity leave; possibly suggesting that the differences in pay are not due to being paid less for the same jobs but for women being prone for differing life-trajectories. </p>

<p> A second emerging theme is the discussion surrounding feminism, and its perceived excessive radical character in particular, with focus on comments about Third Wave Feminism. What is perhaps noticeable is that the discussion revolves around Third, not Fourth Wave feminism specifically, which could be due to it being perceived more moderate and reasonable than its successor. </p> 

### Commenters, videos, and comment repetition 
<p> In this section we looked at whether comments were repeated across videos, using two different maps. </p>

" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;border:1px solid #DDDDDD;" width="1200" height="800" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br />
<font size="2"> Specifics: 1000 nodes, author, video title, raw, proximity threshold 2 </font> <br />

<p> This map looks at videos and comments that appear at least twice. It does not link the comments to the author but shows that multiple videos often have the same kinds of comments, and that they might often lack depth or analytical, albeit, there are a number of longer comments, which can be observed through an examination of the interactive map.  </p>

<p> Nevertheless, there are also a number of longer comments that are repeated amongst the videos, and sometimes occur multiple times in the same video. This indicates that people are either posting on the one video with the same comment and or also posting that same comment on other videos. For example between ‘One woman discovers the gender pay gap’ and the ‘wage gap last week tonight video’ one user has posted the same youtube link which is another wag gap video (that is incidentally included in our corpus as well title of the video ‘but muh wage gap’). </p>

<p> The types of repeated comments vary, some of them being lengthy, while the majority bing single words like ‘lol’, or ‘feminism’ or even ‘0’ (from username Brocoli Assasin). However, what is notable is some comments’ paranoia-spreading nature, for example the user ‘Logic Monkey’ commenting more than once ‘Did you know roughly 50 top comments have been deleted thus far? that’s all of them… you are next’ and ‘Every single Top comments have been deleted since the video was posterd [sic] … like 70 so far. Go ahead start some conversation in the top comments… watch them get deleted… been watching it  for 6 weeks now. When they reach 2k-5k they are deleted. This is a copy and paste… been posting it for 6 weeks :\ ‘, this comment being on the ‘Jordan Peterson debate on gender pay gap, campus protests and postmodernism’, which we found by cross referencing the comment with the video titles on Map 2. </p>

#### Map 2

<font size="2"> Specifics: 1000 nodes, text, video title, raw, proximity threshold 2 </font> <br />

<p> This map links authors who commented the same thing more than once, this can either be the same comment on the one video, for example commenter Muck006 posts the comment beginning with ‘that is her interview style’ more than once on the video ‘Jordan Peterson debate on the gender pay gap, campus protests and postmodernism’. This might be spam but it shows users repeat their points across the same video. Also, there are examples where authors post the same comment on different videos, for example the comment starting with ‘ for every person (or feminist) reading this:’ (in the blue cluster of the top left corner of the map) has been posted on three different videos by the username ‘pietje bel’. This illustrates a repetitive manner of sharing their message by commenters, across several videos, indicating that these users are commenting in a fairly deliberate way rather than just spontaneously reacting to a video they watched. However, it is hard to see whether this deliberate commenting is motivated by a desire to combat a particular message or whether the user, after watching one video and commenting, fell into a trap of watching multiple videos and copy-pasting the same thing. At very least, this demonstrates a high level of interaction with the videos. </p>
