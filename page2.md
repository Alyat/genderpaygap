<p> While the map looks somewhat cluttered at first sight, it reveals 13 quite distinct clusters, as listed below:  

1. Average & Earnings: discussions revolving around money <br />
2. Dumb & Fuck: This is likely related to comments that could be classified as ‘trolling’ and those related to ‘dooming’ gender pay gap. 
3. Scientific & Argument: This could relate to discussions refuting the existence of any scientific arguments for the validity of gender pay gap. <br />
4. News & Fake: Comments referring to gender pay gap as ‘fake news’. <br />
5. Equal & Rape: ‘Rape’ in the map connects to the terms sexual, false, domestic, legal. The emergence of the term in debates surrounding gender inequality is not all that surprising. However, its connection to ‘equal’ is somewhat ambiguous, but could be related to arguments for men facing gender inequality as well, i.e. arguments such as ‘Men get raped too’. <br />
6. Feminists & Feminist: While we separated these in terms, this mutual appearance could be due to the latter being an adjective. These terms appear together with words such as: third, oppressed, radical, western, which could indicate criticism towards feminism and labelling it as a particularly western phenomenon, also criticising its radical nature. <br />
7. Pregnant & Years: Relates to discussions on the topic of having babies, being a mother, and maternity [leave] months. Could be related to arguments explaining the gender pay gap due to women’s absence from work-life due to pregnancy. <br />
8. White & Race: white relates to words describing class differences whereas race to “white, black, human, racist”. Could refer to discussion on whether gender pay gap takes into account differences in income between different ethnicities. <br />
9. Unexplained & Due: arguments on wage gap is unexplainable and can be caused by different factors such as different choices. In addition the word “discrimination” is related to this cluster. <br />
10. Interview & Peterson: Most likely referring to the debate of Jordan Peterson and Cathy Newman on gender pay gap, in videos 1, 66, and 89. <br />
11. Same & Less: Debates revolving around whether women really earn the same or less. <br />
12. Job & Higher: The pay gap between genders being related to differing education, job, position, and careers. <br />
13. Male & Female: An unsurprising cluster in a discussion revolving around gender inequalities. </p>

<p> Furthermore, on multiple accounts explanations other than gender discrimination are offered for the existence of such gap, for example women’s choices concerning their education, career, and family specifically related to maternity leave; possibly suggesting that the differences in pay are not due to being paid less for the same jobs but for women being prone for differing life-trajectories. </p>

<p> A second emerging theme is the discussion surrounding feminism, and its perceived excessive radical character in particular, with focus on comments about Third Wave Feminism. What is perhaps noticeable is that the discussion revolves around Third, not Fourth Wave feminism specifically, which could be due to it being perceived more moderate and reasonable than its successor. </p>
