# Methodology 
<p>To carry out an analysis of the comments, we first decided to collect the 100 most viewed videos, as they represented the most popular content and thus one with the highest degree of interaction from users. To that end, we used YouTube Data Tools, which created a list of video information and statistics from through retrieval by a search query, in our case ‘gender pay gap.’ The script crawled YouTube’s API, collecting both videos and their static data. </p>
<p>We then used the Video Info and Comment Section Module of the Data Tools to collect comments from our list of videos. The tool again uses YouTube’s API to retrieve the following information: <br />
- basic info and statistics about the video; <br />
- all retrievable comments, both top level and replies; <br />
- comment authors and their comment count; <br />
- interactions between users in the comment section in the form of a network file. <br /></p>

<p> We decided to delete videos that had disabled comments or were in foreign languages. Out of 100 initially collected videos, 88 were left, which gave us a total number of around 296916 comments (we were unable to run Corpus Explorer as the size of our dataset was too big). </p>
<p> Having retrieved the comments and information about their users as well as interactions between them, we then used a visual text analytics system (CorText) that allows to apply network analysis to automatically retrieved semantic networks and provides interactive visualization. To that end, we utilised topic modeling with 5 topics, adjectives-adjectives semantic network mapping with 100 and then 200 most common adjectives, network mapping of repetitive comments (appearing at least twice), as well as network mapping of users, videos, and adjectives. The outcomes of these network mappings are addressed in the discussion section. </p>

### Semantic network analysis: nouns and adjectives
<p>We extracted the 200 most popular terms in both adjective and noun groups using Corpus Terms Indexer, and cleaned the lists, allowing for monograms. N-grams such as ‘women and work’ and ‘women that work’ were very frequent. The frequency for the most popular noun was 41,982, and for the least popular noun 1,094. For the adjectives the corresponding frequencies were 42,348 and 37, respectively. </p>

<p> The semantic network was conducted using two parameters of adjectives and nouns. The amount of nodes chosen was 200, and the proximity measure applied chi2 due to the choice of two parameters, applied with a threshold of 0.1. We allowed only short range occurrences within two sentences due to the average of five being too long for the corpus of youtube comments, which tend to be shorter than this, and thus were not conducive to a map of sufficient clarity. </p>

### Commonly occuring adjectives
<p> We also tried to do an analysis of 100 most commonly occurring adjectives, extracting them grouping in categories to ‘positive’, ‘negative’ and ‘neutral, with the neutral category by far the largest. We uploaded them first as terms list, then ran the script Corpus Terms Indexer. </p>
<p> Analysing these in bump-graphs and demography on CorText both standardized and not showed that the neutral category by far was most represented, then the positive and lastly the negative terms, which was similar to the results of the sentiment analysis done in class - unfortunately it was hard to make any definitive analysis of the sentiment in the comments. It may be because many of the terms grouped as ‘neutral’ e.g. radical, wrong, female, basic, biological, liberal, western, white, black, and false are used negatively (or positively), having no inherent value judgements in themselves. It is further worth noting that many YouTube comments are highly ironic or sarcastic. </p>
